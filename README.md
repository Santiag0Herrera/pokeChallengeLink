# Challenge REDLINK


## Description
This is a quick challenge in which I show my skills developing a functional and resposive React project, which has as many reusable components as possible. This project was made by Santiago Herrera 04/26/2023 as part of an interview with REDLINK.
## Technologies used
* Node
* React
* React Router
* CSS
* Material UI
* Axios
* Pokemon API (Endpoint: https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=50)
## Setup
1. **Clone this git repository using your terminal, in the folder where you wish the project to be located.**
```
git clone https://github.com/Santiag0Herrera/pokeChallengeLink.git
```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**
```
cd CHALLENGE-LINK
```
3. **Make sure to have these versions installed in your computer:**
    * Node -> 18.15.0 *or compatible* (you can download Node from this website https://nodejs.org/en ).
    * Node Package Manager -> 9.5.0 *or compatible* (You need to have Node installed on your computer before this step)
```
npm install 9.5.0
```
## Dependencies Installation
1. **React Router**
```
npm install react-router-dom
```
2. **Axios**
```
npm install axios
```
3. **Material UI**
```
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```
## Execution
1. Before starting and running this project, ensure that you have the correct versions installed as specified previously.
After completing all the installations, run the following command in your terminal to ensure that all dependencies have been installed correctly:
```
npm install
```
Finally, execute the following command in your terminal to launch the project:
``` 
npm start
```
This will launch the project in a new browser window. If a window does not open automatically, go to http://localhost:3000/ .
